- You can access API endpoint at "localhost/api/", and frontend at "localhost".
- Portainer is accessible at "localhost:9000". Make sure you create an admin account before 5 minutes or container stops.
- Redis-commander is accessible at "localhost:8085" for monitoring redis caches.
- [API endpoints documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10900080/SzzdC1NW) .
